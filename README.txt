1. Explain how Copilot assisted in generating integration code, debugging issues, structuring JSON responses, and optimizing performance.
	By using keyword prompts and copy/pasting sections of code into copilot I was able to generate a integration code that connected both the 
Frontend/ClientApp and Backend/ServerApp together. Copilot gave structure to the clientApp by adding isLoading and hasError to improve the UI clarity 
and control flow of the application. Copilot explained some debugging techniques in a step by step process which allowed for a cleaner and finalised 
product. In order to structure JSON responses, copilot informed me of how useful a controllers folder within the ServerApp folder would be.
This also provides a foundation to set up APIs easier and to build on in the future.
 
2. Highlight any challenges you encountered and how Copilot helped you overcome them.
	The main Issue I discovered throughout this process, even with the help of copilot, were the amount of errors and the specific nature 
of API endpoints. Getting a single character wrong meant a very arduous task of finding the issue. I also have difficulties with network related issues
so getting the launchsettings.json files correctly formatted was another difficult task.

3. Discuss what you learned about using Copilot effectively in a full-stack development context.
	Copilot was quintessential in not only bettering my understanding of APIs, but also in providing bugfixes, error handling, logging, and 
maintaining a connection between the frontend and backend of an full stack application. Copilot helped to structure, optimize and apply the best 
practices for software development
